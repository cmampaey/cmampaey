### Hello there! 👋🏼

Welcome to my learning experience!

- 💻 I'm currently diving deep into the world of coding through the [CS50w](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) course.
- 🌐 Along this journey, I'm getting hands-on with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
- 🏌️‍♂️ When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the greens, mastering my swing and chasing that elusive hole-in-one.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow learners and enthusiasts!
